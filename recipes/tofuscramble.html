        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>I’ve always enjoyed tofu, but I didn’t make tofu scrambles until I started dating a vegan. 
            I still eat eggs, but on weekends, I now look forward to our easygoing late-morning breakfasts
            of tofu scramble with slices of well-buttered (or plant-buttered) toast.
            Don’t get locked into breakfast though—tofu scramble makes a speedy at-home lunch, or a handy weeknight “brinner.”</p>
        <p>Think of tofu scramble as a hearty yet healthy dish in its own right, and not a second-class stand in for eggs. 
            Tofu scramble takes minutes to make, utilizes ingredients you have on hand, and is packed with protein. </p>
